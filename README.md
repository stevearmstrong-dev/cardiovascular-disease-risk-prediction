# Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction

### Introduction and Motivation

This project aims to develop a robust predictive model for assessing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using the random forest algorithm. Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of mortality globally. Early risk prediction can significantly improve outcomes through timely intervention and preventative measures. This project combines data exploration, visualization, and machine learning to provide insights into CVD risk factors and predict individual risk levels.

### Features

* Data Exploration and Visualization: Utilizing seaborn and Matplotlib for in-depth analysis and visualization of dataset attributes.
* Data Preprocessing: Employing Scikit-learn for data cleaning and preparation tasks.
* Predictive Modeling: Building and training a random forest classifier to accurately predict CVD risk.

### Dataset
The dataset comprises variables such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other significant CVD risk factors.
